The target is required.
The target may be a relative path or a URL.
How the target is interpreted depends on the processor settings and/or output format.
If the converter generates output that references the image, the path must be relative to the published document.
If the converter embeds the image in the output document (e.g., inline SVG, `data-uri` is set, converting to PDF directly), the target must be resolvable at convert time.
In the latter case, a URL will only be resolved if the security settings on the processor allows it (e.g., `allow-uri-read`).

The target may contain space characters.
In the HTML output, these spaces will be URL encoded (i.e., `%20`).
