= Button and Menu UI Macros

IMPORTANT: You must set the `experimental` attribute to enable the UI macros.

== Button macro syntax

It can be difficult to communicate to the reader that they need to press a button.
They can't tell if you are saying "`OK`" or they are supposed to look for a button labeled *OK*.
It's all about getting the semantics right.
The `btn` macro to the rescue!

The result of <<ex-btn>> is displayed below.

include::example$ui.adoc[tag=button]

== Menu macro syntax

Trying to explain how to select a menu item can be a pain.
With the `menu` macro, the symbols do the work.

[source#ex-menu]
