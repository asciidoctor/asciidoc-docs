= Validate Cross References

An AsciiDoc processor is only required to provide limited support for validating internal cross references.
Validation occurs when a cross reference is first visited.
Since there are still some references aren't stored in the parse tree (such as an anchor in the middle of a paragraph), which can lead to false positives, these validations are hidden behind a flag.

You can enable validation of cross references from the CLI by passing the `-v` and from the API by setting the `$VERBOSE` variable to `true`.
This puts the processor in pedantic mode.
In this mode, the parser will immediately validate cross references, issuing a warning message if the reference is not valid.

Consider the following example:

----
See <<foobar>>.

[#foobaz]
== Foobaz
----

If you run Asciidoctor in verbose/pedantic mode on this document (`-v`), it will send the following warning message to the logger.

....
asciidoctor: WARNING: invalid reference: foobar
....

An AsciiDoc processor is only required to validate references within the same document (after any includes are resolved).
