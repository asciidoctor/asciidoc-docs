= Image Icons

To display icons using your own images, set the `icons` attribute to an empty value in the document header.
This strategy is recommended if you are converting to DocBook or you want an easy way to make HTML for viewing offline.
The DocBook toolchain provides images for the admonition and callout icons, which you can replace with your own custom icons.
If you use the inline icon macro, you'll need to provide the images for those icons.

== Using the inline icon macro with an image

An icon can be inserted at an arbitrary place in paragraph content with an inline macro.
Here's an example that inserts an icon named _tags_ in front of a list of tag names.

icon:tags[] ruby, asciidoctor

Here's how the HTML converter converts an icon macro when the `icons` attribute is not set or empty.

.Result: HTML output
[source,html]
----
<div class="paragraph">
  <p><span class="image"><img src="./images/icons/tags.png" alt="tags"></span> ruby, asciidoctor</p>
</div>
----

Here's how it looks.

Here's how the DocBook converter converts an icon macro.

.Result: DocBook output
[source,xml]
----
<inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="./images/icons/tags.png"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>tags</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject> ruby, asciidoctor

When the image for an icon can't be located in the icons directory, Asciidoctor displays the icon macro's fallback text.

== Icon macro attributes for images

The attributes listed below are only apply when font-based icons are not in use.

`alt`::
The alternative text on the `<img>` tag (HTML backend) or text for `<inlinemediaobject>` (DocBook converter)

`width`::
The width applied to the image

`height`::
The height applied to the image

`title`::
The title of the image displayed when the mouse hovers over it (HTML converter)

`role`::
The role applied to the element that surrounds the icon

For example, here's how the icon color is specified by assigning it a role.

----
icon:tags[role="blue"] ruby, asciidoctor

.Result: Inline icon macro and role
====
icon:tags[role=blue] ruby, asciidoctor

The inline icon macro doesn't support any options to change its physical position (such as alignment).

== Link and window attributes

It's possible to add additional metadata to an inline icon.
The `link` and `window` attributes apply to both font-based and image-based icons.

`link`::
The URI target used for the icon, which will wrap the converted icon in a link

`window`::
The target window of the link (when the `link` attribute is specified) (HTML converter)

Here's an example of an icon with a link:

----
icon:download[link="https://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-2.0.10.gem"]
