= Unicode Icons

You can use Unicode glyphs as icons.

== Use Unicode characters as admonition icons

Since Unicode characters are classified as text, *don't set the `icons` attribute*.
If the `icons` attribute is not set on the document, Asciidoctor outputs an admonition's label as text (e.g., CAUTION).
The text for this label comes from an AsciiDoc attribute.
The name of the attribute is `<type>-caption`, where `<type>` is the admonition type in lowercase.
For example, the attribute for a tip admonition is `tip-caption`.

Instead of a word, you can assign a Unicode glyph to this attribute:

[source]
----
:tip-caption: ðŸ’¡

Here's the HTML that Asciidoctor outputs for the icon cell:

[source,html]
----
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">ðŸ’¡</div>
</td>
----

Instead of entering the glyph directly, you can enter a character reference instead.
However, since you're defining the character reference in an attribute entry, you (currently) have to disable substitutions on the value.

[source]
----
:tip-caption: pass:[&#128161;]

On GitHub, the HTML output that Asciidoctor emits is run through a postprocessing filter that substitutes emoji shortcodes with emoji symbols.
That means you can use these shortcodes in the value of the attribute:

[source]
----
\ifdef::env-github[]
:tip-caption: :bulb:
\endif::[]

[TIP]

When the document is processed through the GitHub interface, the shortcodes get replaced with real emojis.
This is the only known way to get admonition icons to work on GitHub.
