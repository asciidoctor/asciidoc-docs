= SVG Images

Both block and inline image macros have built-in support for scalable vector graphics (SVGs).
But there's more than one way to include an SVG into a web page, and the strategy used can effect how the SVG behaves (or misbehaves).
Therefore, these macros provide additional options to control how the SVG is included (i.e., referenced).

== Options for SVG images

When the image target is an SVG, the `options` attribute on the macro accepts one of three values:

* _none_ (default)
* `interactive`
* `inline`

The following table demonstrates the impact these options have.

.Demonstration of option values for SVG images
[cols="l,a"]
|===
|image::sample.svg[Static,300]
|image::sample.svg[Static,300]

|image::sample.svg[Interactive,300,opts=interactive]
|image::sample.svg[Interactive,300,opts=interactive]

Observe that the color changes when hovering over the SVG.

|image::sample.svg[Embedded,300,opts=inline]
|image::sample.svg[Embedded,300,opts=interactive]
// the output uses the interactive version as the documentation doesn't currently support the `inline` option.

Observe that the color changes when hovering over the SVG.
The SVG also inherits CSS from the document stylesheets.

How the options value works and when it should be used is described below:

.Option values for SVG images (HTML output)
[%autowidth]
|===
|Option |HTML Element Used |Effect |When To Use

|_none_ (default)
|`<img>`
|Image is rasterized
|Static image, no interactivity, no custom fonts

|`interactive`
|`<object>`
|Image embedded as a live, interactive object
|For using CSS animations, scripting, webfonts

|`inline`
|`<svg>`
|The SVG is embedded directly into the HTML itself
|For using CSS animations, scripting, webfonts, when you require search engines to search the SVG content

To allow SVG content reachable by JavaScript in the main DOM or to inherit styles from the main DOM
|===

When using the `inline` or `interactive` options, the `viewBox` attribute must be defined on the root `<svg>` element in order for scaling to work properly.

When using the `inline` option, if you specify a width or height on the image macro in AsciiDoc, the `width`, `height` and `style` attributes on the `<svg>` element will be removed. Additionally, when using `inline` the primary SVG elements (e.g., `<svg>`) cannot have a namespace.

If using the `interactive` option, you must link to the CSS that declares the fonts in the SVG file using an XML stylesheet declaration.

If you're inserting an SVG using either the `inline` or `interactive` options, we strongly recommend you optimize your SVG using a tool like {url-svgo}[svgo^] or {url-svg-editor}[SVG Editor^].

As you work with SVG, you'll become more comfortable making the decision about which method to employ given the circumstances.
It's only confusing when you first encounter the choice.
