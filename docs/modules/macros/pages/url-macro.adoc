= URL Macro
// The term URL is now preferred over the term URI. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URLs_and_URNs

If you're familiar with the AsciiDoc syntax, you may notice that a URL almost looks like an inline macro.
All that's missing is the pair of the trailing square brackets.
In fact, if you add them, then a URL is treated an an inline macro.
We call this a URL macro.

This page introduces the URL macro, when you would want to use it, and how it differs from the link macro.

== From URL to macro

To transform a URL into a macro, add a pair of square brackets to the end of the URL.
For example:

[source]
----
https://asciidoctor.org[]
----

Since no text is specified, this macro behaves the same as an autolink.
In this case, the link automatically gets assigned the "bare" role.

When the URL is followed by a pair of square brackets, the URL scheme dually serves as the macro name.
AsciiDoc recognizes all the xref:autolinks.adoc#schemes[URL schemes] for autolinks as macro names.
That's why we say "URL macros" and not just "URL macro".
It's a family of macros.
With the exception of the xref:mailto-macro.adoc[mailto macro], all the URL macros behave the same, and also behave the same as the xref:link-macro.adoc[link macro].

So why might you upgrade from a URL to a URL macro?
One reason is to force the URL to be parsed when it would not normally be recognized, such as if it's enclosed in double quotes:

[source]
----
Type "https://asciidoctor.org[]" into the location bar of your browser.
----

The more typical reason, however, is to specify custom link text.

[#link-text]
== Custom link text

Instead of displaying the URL, you can configure the link to display custom text.
When the reader clicks on the text, they are directed to the target of the link, the URL.

To customize the text of the link, insert that text between the square brackets of the URL macro.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=irc]
----

Since the text is subject to normal substitutions, you can apply formatting to it.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=text]
----

== Link attributes

You can use the attribute list to further customize the link, such as to make it target a new window and apply a role to it.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=css]
----

To understand how the text between the square brackets of a URL macro is parsed, see xref:link-macro-attribute-parsing.adoc[attribute parsing].
