The character replacement substitution step processes textual characters such as marks, arrows and dashes and replaces them with the decimal format of their Unicode code point, i.e., their <<char-ref-sidebar,numeric character reference>>.
The replacements step depends on the substitutions completed by the xref:special-characters.adoc[special characters step].

This substitution step also recognizes {url-html-ref}[HTML and XML character references^] as well as {url-unicode}[decimal and hexadecimal Unicode code points^] and substitutes them for their corresponding decimal form Unicode code point.

For example, to produce the `&sect;` symbol you could write `\&sect;`, `\&#x00A7;`, or `\&#167;`.
When the document is processed, `replacements` will replace the section symbol reference, regardless of whether it is a named character reference or a numeric character reference, with `\&#167;`.
In turn, `\&#167;` will display as &sect;.

An AsciiDoc processor allows you to use any of the named character references (aka named entities) defined in HTML (e.g., \&euro; resolves to &euro;).
However, using named character references can cause problems when generating non-HTML output such as PDF because the lookup table needed to resolve these names may not be defined.
The recommendation is avoid using named character references, with the exception of the well-known ones defined in XML (i.e., lt, gt, amp, quot, apos).
Instead, use numeric character references (e.g., \&#8364;).

.Anatomy of a character reference
****
A character reference is a standard sequence of characters that is substituted for a single character by an AsciiDoc processor.
There are two types of character references: named character references and numeric character references.

A named character reference (often called a _character entity reference_) is a short name that refers to a character (i.e., glyph).
To make the reference, the name must be prefixed with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).

For example:

* `\&dagger;` displays as &dagger;
* `\&euro;` displays as &euro;
* `\&loz;` displays as &loz;

Numeric character references are the decimal or hexadecimal Universal Character Set/Unicode code points which refer to a character.

* The decimal code point references are prefixed with an ampersand (`&`), followed by a hash (`&#35;`), and end with a semicolon (`;`).
* Hexadecimal code point references are prefixed with an ampersand (`&`), followed by a hash (`&#35;`), followed by a lowercase `x`, and end with a semicolon (`;`).

For example:

* `\&#x2020;` or `\&#8224;` displays as &#8224;
* `\&#x20AC;` or `\&#8364;` displays as &#8364;
* `\&#x25CA;` or `\&#9674;` displays as &#x25CA;

Developers may be more familiar with using *Unicode escape sequences* to perform text substitutions.
For example, to produce an `&#64;` sign using a Unicode escape sequence, you would prefix the hexadecimal Unicode code point with a backslash (`\`) and an uppercase or lowercase `u`, i.e. `u0040`.
However, the AsciiDoc syntax doesn't recognize Unicode escape sequences at this time.

TIP: AsciiDoc also provides built-in attributes for representing some common symbols.
These attributes and their corresponding output are listed in xref:attributes:character-replacement-ref.adoc[].

== replacements substitution value

The replacements substitution step can be modified on blocks and inline elements.
For blocks, the step's name, `replacements`, can be assigned to the xref:apply-subs-to-blocks.adoc[subs attribute].
For inline elements, the built-in values `r` or `replacements` can be applied to xref:apply-subs-to-text.adoc[inline text] to add the replacements substitution step.

WARNING: The replacements step depends on the substitutions completed by the xref:special-characters.adoc[special characters step].
This is important to keep in mind when applying the `replacements` value to blocks and inline elements.
