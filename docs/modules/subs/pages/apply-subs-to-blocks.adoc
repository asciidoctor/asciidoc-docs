= Customize the Substitutions Applied to Blocks

== The subs attribute

Substitution steps or groups can be applied to any block and certain inline elements by setting the `subs` attribute and assigning it a comma-separated list of one or more of the substitution group or step values.

[#subs-groups]
`none`:: Substitution group that disables all substitutions.

`normal`:: Substitution group that performs all substitution types except callouts.

`verbatim`:: Substitution group that replaces special characters and processes callouts.

`specialchars`:: Substitution step that replaces `<`, `>`, and `&` with their corresponding entities.

`callouts`:: Substitution step that processes callouts in literal, listing, and source blocks.

`quotes`:: Substitution step that applies inline text formatting.

`attributes`:: Substitution step that replaces attribute references.

`replacements`:: Substitution step that replaces hexadecimal Unicode code points and entity, HTML, and XML character references with the characters' decimal Unicode code point.
The output of `replacements` may depend on whether the `specialcharacters` substitution was previously applied.

`macros`:: Substitution step that processes inline and block macros.

`post_replacements`:: Substitution step that processes the line break character (`{plus}`).

== Set the subs attribute on a block

Let's look at an example where you only want to process special characters, inline formatting markup, and callouts in a literal block.
By default, literal blocks are only subject to special characters substitution.
But you can change this behavior by setting the `subs` attribute in the block's attribute list.

....
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-in]
....
<.> The `subs` attribute is set in the attribute list and assigned the `verbatim` and `quotes` values.
<.> The formatting markup in this line will be replaced when the `quotes` step runs.

====
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-out]
====
<.> The `verbatim` value enables any special characters and callouts to be processed.
<.> The `quotes` value enables the bold text formatting to be processed.

You may be wondering why `verbatim` is specified in the previous example since it's applied to literal blocks by default.
It's added because the `subs` attribute removes all of a block or inline elements default substitutions when it is set.
The next section explains this concept in more detail.

[#incremental]
== Add and remove substitution types from a default substitution group

When you set the `subs` attribute on a block, you automatically remove all of its default substitutions.
For example, if you set `subs` on a literal block, and assign it a value of `attributes`, only attribute references are substituted.
The `verbatim` substitution group will not be applied.
To remedy this situation, AsciiDoc provides a syntax to append or remove substitutions instead of replacing them outright.

You can add or remove a substitution type from the default substitution group using the plus (`+`) and minus (`-`) modifiers.
These are known as [.term]*incremental substitutions*.

`<substitution>+`::
Prepends the substitution to the default list.

`+<substitution>`::
Appends the substitution to the default list.

`-<substitution>`::
Removes the substitution from the default list.

For example, you can add the `attributes` substitution to the beginning of a listing block's default substitution group by placing the plus (`+`) modifier at the end of the `attributes` value.

.Add attributes substitution to default substitution group
[source]
....
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-add]
....

Similarly, you can remove the `callouts` substitution from a block's default substitution group by placing the minus (`-`) modifier in front of the `callouts` value.

.Remove callouts substitution from default substitution group
[source,subs=-callouts]
....
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-sub]
....

You can also specify whether the substitution type is added to the end of the substitution group.
If a `+` comes before the name of the substitution, then it's added to the end of the existing list, whereas if a `+` comes after the name, it's added to the beginning of the list.

[source,subs=-callouts]
....
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-multi]
....

In the above example, the `attributes` substitution step is added to the beginning of the default substitution group, the `replacements` step is added to the end of the group, and the `callouts` step is removed from the group.

// NOTE: More examples are pending. Information about the callouts substitution also needs to be included here.

[TIP]
====
If you are applying the same set of substitutions to numerous blocks, you should consider making them an attribute entry to ensure consistency.

[source]
....
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=subs-attr]
....

Another way to ensure consistency and keep your documents clean and simple is to use the xref:asciidoctor:extensions:tree-processor.adoc[tree Processor extension].
