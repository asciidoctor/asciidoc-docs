:keywords: numbered list

== Basic ordered list

Sometimes, we need to number the items in a list.
Instinct might tell you to prefix each item with a number, like in this next list:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base-num]
----

The above works, but since the numbering is obvious, the AsciiDoc processor will insert the numbers for you if you omit them:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base]
----

====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base]
====

If you manually number your ordered list, you have to keep the items sequential.
This differs from other lightweight markup languages.
It's one way to adjust the numbering offset of a list.
For instance, you can type:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base-num-start]
----

In general, though, rather than typing numbers, if you need to interrupt the default sequence, use the `start` attribute:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base-start]
----

When your ordered-list items include multiple block elements—images, captions, code, tables, paragraphs, source blocks, etc., as is often the case when you document steps in a procedure—your steps may reset to 1 when you don't want them to.
In these cases, don't use the `start` attribute to continue the numbering.
You don't want to have to manually update `start` numbers or risk having the `start` numbers become wrong every time you add or remove a step.
Instead, use a list continuation—a `{plus}` symbol on its own line—between block elements.
The list continuation glues the elements together within a given step.
If a step includes any blank lines between elements, the next step goes back to 1.
(A blank line directly before a step has no effect on step numbering.)
The list continuation also keeps the elements aligned at the same level of indent, as shown here:

* For how-to details, see the xref:continuation.adoc[] section of this documentation.
* For an example of the list continuation used in a complex ordered list, see the launch steps in https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-microsoft-sql-fci-fsx/edit/main/docs/partner_editable/deploy_steps.adoc[this .adoc file in GitHub^].
* To see how those launch steps look in the final output, see the https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-microsoft-sql-fci-fsx/#_launch_the_quick_start[Launch the Quick Start^] section of the generated deployment guide. The list continuations prevent step 2 from resetting to 1. They also prevent step 5, which is pulled in from a separate .adoc file, from resetting to 1.

To present list items in reverse order, add the `reversed` option:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=reversed]
----

====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=reversed]
====

You can give a list a title by prefixing the line with a dot immediately followed by the text (without leaving any space after the dot).

Here's an example of a list with a title:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base-t]
----

====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=base-t]
====

== Nested ordered list

// tag::basic[]
You create a nested item by using one or more dots in front of each the item.

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=nest]
----

AsciiDoc selects a different number scheme for each level of nesting.
Here's how the previous list renders:

.A nested ordered list
====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=nest]
====
// end::basic[]

[TIP]
====
Like with the asterisks in an unordered list, the number of dots in an ordered list doesn't represent the nesting level.
However, it's much more intuitive to follow this convention:

*# of dots = level of nesting*

Again, we are shooting for plain text markup that is readable _as is_.
====

You can mix and match the three list types, ordered, xref:unordered.adoc[unordered], and xref:description.adoc[description], within a single hybrid list.
The AsciiDoc syntax tries hard to infer the relationships between the items that are most intuitive to us humans.

Here's an example of nesting an unordered list inside of an ordered list:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=mix]
----

====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=mix]
====

You can spread the items out and indent the nested lists if that makes it more readable for you:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=mix-alt]
----

The description list page demonstrates how to xref:description.adoc#three-hybrid[combine all three list types].

== Number styles

For ordered lists, AsciiDoc supports the numeration styles such as lowergreek and decimal-leading-zero.
The full list of numeration styles that can be applied to an ordered list are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Block style |CSS list-style-type

|arabic
|decimal

|decimal ^[1]^
|decimal-leading-zero

|loweralpha
|lower-alpha

|upperalpha
|upper-alpha

|lowerroman
|lower-roman

|upperroman
|upper-roman

|lowergreek ^[1]^
|lower-greek
|===
^[1]^ These styles are only supported by the HTML converters.

Here are a few examples showing various numeration styles as defined by the block style shown in the header row:

[%autowidth]
|===
|[arabic] ^[2]^ |[decimal] |[loweralpha] |[lowergreek]

a|
. one
. two
. three

a|
[decimal]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[loweralpha]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[lowergreek]
. one
. two
. three
|===
^[2]^ Default numeration if block style is not specified

TIP: Custom numeration styles can be implemented using a custom role.
Define a new class selector (e.g., `.custom`) in your stylesheet that sets the `list-style-type` property to the value of your choice.
Then, assign the name of that class as a role on any list to which you want that numeration applied.

When the role shorthand (`.custom`) is used on an ordered list, the numeration style is no longer omitted.

You can override the number scheme for any level by setting its style (the first positional entry in a block attribute list).
You can also set the starting number using the `start` attribute:

----
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=num]
----

====
include::example$ordered.adoc[tag=num]
====

IMPORTANT: The `start` attribute must be a number, even when using a different numeration style.
For instance, to start an alphabetic list at letter "c", set the numeration style to loweralpha and the start attribute to 3.
