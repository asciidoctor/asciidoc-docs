== Build a delimited block

In this section, we'll create a delimited sidebar block.
The delimiter for the sidebar style is four asterisks (`+****+`).

. Enter the opening delimiter at the beginning of a new line and then press kbd:[Enter].
+
----
Text in your document.

****

----

. On the new line, enter your content, such as paragraphs, delimited blocks, directives, and macros.
The delimited block's style will be applied to all of this content until the closing delimiter.
+
----
Text in your document.

****
This is content in a sidebar block.

This is more content in the sidebar block.
----

. To end the delimited block, press kbd:[Enter] at the end of your last line of content.
On the new line, type the closing delimiter.
+
----
Text in your document.

****
This is content in a sidebar block.

This is more content in the sidebar block.

That's it.
You've built a delimited block.

== Build a block from a paragraph

In some cases, you can style a block using the style's name.
If the content is contiguous (not interrupted by blank lines), you can assign the block style's name in an attribute list placed above the content.
This format is often used for single-line listings:

[source]
....
include::example$block.adoc[tag=opt-listing]
....

or single-line quotes:

----
include::example$block.adoc[tag=quote-name]

== Summary of built-in blocks
// This section is just hanging here for the moment, it's not its final destination, I just didn't want to comment it out.

The following table identifies the built-in block styles, their delimiter syntax, purposes, and the substitutions performed on their contents.

include::partial$block-name-table.adoc[]

////
This table shows the substitutions performed by each substitution group referenced in the previous table.

include::partial$subs-group-table.adoc[]

OMG. What does this random tip apply to????
TIP: Surround an attribute value with single quotes in order to apply normal substitutions.
