= Admonitions

// tag::intro[]
There are certain statements you may want to draw attention to by taking them out of the content's flow and labeling them with a priority.
These are called admonitions.
It's rendered style is determined by the assigned label (i.e., value).
Asciidoctor provides five admonition style labels:

* `NOTE`
* `TIP`
* `IMPORTANT`
* `CAUTION`
* `WARNING`

.Caution vs. Warning
[#caution-vs-warning]
****
When choosing the admonition type, you may find yourself getting confused between "caution" and "warning" as these words are often used interchangeably.
Here's a simple rule to help you differentiate the two:

* Use *CAUTION* to advise the reader to _act_ carefully (i.e., exercise care).
* Use *WARNING* to inform the reader of danger, harm, or consequences that exist.

When you want to call attention to a single paragraph, start the first line of the paragraph with the label you want to use.
The label must be uppercase and followed by a colon (`:`).

When you want to apply an admonition to complex content, set the label as a style attribute on a block.
As seen in the next example, admonition labels are commonly set on example blocks.
This behavior is referred to as *masquerading*.
The label must be uppercase when set as an attribute on a block.

== Enable admonition icons

In the examples above, the admonition is rendered in a callout box with the style label in the gutter.
You can replace the textual labels with icons by setting the `icons` attribute on the document.
This is how the WARNING admonition paragraph renders when icons is set and assigned the `font` value.

=== Using emoji for admonition icons

If image-based or font-based icons are not available, you can leverage the admonition caption to display an emoji (or any symbol from Unicode) in the place of the admonition label, thus giving you an alternative way to make admonition icons.

If the `icons` attribute is not set on the document, the admonition label is shown as text (e.g., CAUTION).
The text for this label comes from an AsciiDoc attribute.
The name of the attribute is `<type>-caption`, where `<type>` is the admonition type in lowercase.
For example, the attribute for a tip admonition is `tip-caption`.

Instead of a word, you can assign a Unicode glyph to this attribute:

[source]
----
:tip-caption: ðŸ’¡

[TIP]
It's possible to use Unicode glyphs as admonition icons.
----

Here's the result you get in the HTML:

[source,html]
----
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">ðŸ’¡</div>
</td>
----

Instead of entering the glyph directly, you can enter a character reference instead.
However, since you're defining the character reference in an attribute entry, you (currently) have to disable substitutions on the value.

[source]
----
:tip-caption: pass:[&#128161;]

[TIP]
It's possible to use Unicode glyphs as admonition icons.
----

On GitHub, the HTML output from the AsciiDoc processor is run through a postprocessing filter that substitutes emoji shortcodes with emoji symbols.
That means you can use these shortcodes instead in the value of the attribute:

[source]
----
\ifdef::env-github[]
:tip-caption: :bulb:
\endif::[]

[TIP]
It's possible to use emojis as admonition icons on GitHub.
----

When the document is processed through the GitHub interface, the shortcodes get replaced with real emojis.
This is the only known way to get admonition icons to work on GitHub.
