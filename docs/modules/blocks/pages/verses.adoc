= Verses

When you need to preserve indents and line breaks, use a `verse` block.
Verses are defined by setting `verse` on a paragraph or an excerpt block delimited by four underscores (`+____+`).

When verse content doesn't contain any blank lines, you can assign the `verse` style using the first position in an attribute list.
