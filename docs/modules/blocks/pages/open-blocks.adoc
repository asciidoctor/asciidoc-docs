= Open Blocks

The most versatile block of all is the open block.
It allows you to apply block attributes to a chunk of text without giving it any other semantics.
In other words, it provides a generic structural container for enclosing content.
The only notable limitation is that an open block cannot be nested inside of another open block.

An open block can act as any other block, with the exception of _pass_ and _table_.
