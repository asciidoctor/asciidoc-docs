= Paragraph Alignment

AsciiDoc provides built-in roles to align the text of a paragraph.
The name of the role follows the pattern `text-<alignment>`, where `<alignment>` is one of left, center, right, or justify (e.g., `text-center`).

In <<ex-center>>, the paragraph is assigned the `text-center` role in an attribute list.

.Assign text-center to a paragraph
[#ex-center]
----
[.text-center]
This text is centered, so it must be important.
----

These built-in text alignment roles may not be honored by all converters.
Though, you can expect them to be supported when the output format is either HTML or PDF.
