= Preamble and Lead Style

[#preamble-style]
== Preamble

Content between the end of the xref:document:header.adoc[document header] and the first section title in the document body is called the preamble.
A preamble is optional.

.Preamble
[#ex-preamble]

include::example$preamble.adoc[]

When using the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, if the first paragraph does not have an explicit role, it is styled as if it has the <<lead-role,lead role>>.
The result of <<ex-preamble>> is displayed below.

[#lead-role]
== Lead role

Apply the `lead` role to any paragraph, and it will render using a larger font size.
The lead role is assigned to the xref:attributes:role.adoc[role attribute].
You can set `role` using the classic or shorthand method.

[#ex-lead]
----
include::example$paragraph.adoc[tag=lead]

The result of <<ex-lead>> is displayed below.

When you convert a document to HTML using the default stylesheet, the first paragraph of the <<preamble-style,preamble>> is automatically styled as a lead paragraph.
To disable this behavior, assign any role to the first paragraph.

.Disabling the automatic lead paragraph styling
----
include::example$paragraph.adoc[tag=no-lead]
----

The presence of the custom role (`normal`) informs the CSS not to style it as a lead paragraph.
