= Hard Line Breaks

Since adjacent lines of text are combined into a single paragraph when Asciidoctor converts a document, that means you can wrap paragraph text or put each sentence or phrase on a separate line.
The line breaks won't appear in the output.

However, if you want the line breaks in a paragraph to be preserved, you can use a space followed by a plus sign (`{plus}`) or set the `hardbreaks` option on the paragraph.
All of the line breaks in paragarphs for an entire document can be preserved with the `hardbreaks-option` document attribute.

TIP: Hard line breaks are automatically retained in xref:verbatim:literal-blocks.adoc[literal], xref:verbatim:listing-blocks.adoc[listing], xref:verbatim:source-blocks.adoc[source], and xref:verses.adoc[verse] blocks and paragraphs.

[#per-line]
== Inline line break syntax

To preserve a line break in a paragraph, type a blank space followed by a plus sign (`{plus}`) at the end of the line.
This results in a visible line break (e.g., `<br>`) following the line.
