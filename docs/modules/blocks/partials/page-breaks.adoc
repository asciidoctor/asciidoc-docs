== Page breaks

A line with three less-than characters (i.e., `<<<`), shown in <<ex-page-break>>, is a special macro that serves as a hint to the converter to insert a page break.
Like other block forms, the line must be offset by a preceding paragraph by at least one blank line.

A page break is only relevant for page-oriented / printable output formats such as DocBook, PDF, and HTML in print mode.

If the page break macro falls at the top of an empty page, it will be ignored.
This behavior can be overridden by setting the `always` option on the macro as shown in <<ex-forced-page-break>>.

Some converters support additional options on the page break macro.
For example, Asciidoctor PDF allows the page layout of the new page to be specified.
