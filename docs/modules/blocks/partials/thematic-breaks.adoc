== Thematic breaks

A line with three single quotation marks (i.e., `pass:[''']`), shown in <<ex-rule>>, is a special macro that inserts a thematic break (aka horizontal rule).
Like other block forms, the line must be offset by a preceding paragraph by at least one empty line.

=== Markdown-style thematic breaks

Asciidoctor recognizes Markdown thematic breaks.
The motivation for this support is to ease migration of Markdown documents to AsciiDoc documents.

To avoid conflicts with AsciiDoc's block delimiter syntax, only 3 repeating characters (`-` or `+*+`) are recognized.
As with Markdown, spaces between the characters is optional.
