|Style |Operator |Description

|AsciiDoc
|`a`
|Supports block elements (lists, delimited blocks, and block macros).
This style effectively creates a nested, standalone AsciiDoc document.
The parent document's implicit attributes, such as `doctitle`, are shadowed and custom attributes are inherited.
// what does "shadowed" actually mean???

|Default
|`d`
|All of the markup that is permitted in a paragraph (i.e., inline formatting, inline macros) is supported.

|Emphasis
|`e`
|Text is italicized.

|Header
|`h`
|Applies the header semantics and styles to the text and cell borders.

|Literal
|`l`
|Content is treated as if it were inside a literal block.

|Monospace
|`m`
|Text is rendered using a monospace font.

|Strong
|`s`
|Text is bold.
