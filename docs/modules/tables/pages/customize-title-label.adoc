= Customize the Title Label
:table-caption: Data Set

When you xref:add-title.adoc[add a title to a table], the processor automatically prefixes it with the label _Table <n>._, where _<n>_ is the 1-based index of all of the titled tables in the document.
This label can be modified at the document level or per table.
It can also be xref:turn-off-title-label.adoc[deactivated].

== Modify the label using table-caption

You can change the label for all titled tables using the document attribute `table-caption`.
(Don't let the attribute's name mislead you.
It's the attribute that controls the table title labels at the document level.)

In the document header, set the `table-caption` attribute and assign it your custom label text.

[source]
----
= Document Title
:table-caption: Data Set <.> <.>
----
<.> Set the document attribute `table-caption` and assign it the text you want to precede each table title.
<.> Don't enter a number after the label text.
The processor will automatically insert and increment the number.

In <<ex-label>>, the first and third tables have a title, but the second table doesn't have a title.

Since `table-caption` is assigned the value `Data Set`, any table title should be preceded with the label _Data Set <n>._
The three tables from <<ex-label>> are displayed below.

Notice that the table that doesn't have a title didn't get a label nor was it counted when the processor incremented the label number.
Therefore, the third table is assigned the label _Data Set 2._

== Modify the label of an individual table using caption

You can customize the label on an individual table by setting the `caption` attribute.
(Don't let the name of the attribute mislead you.
The caption attribute only sets the caption's label, not the whole caption line).
When using `caption`, assign it the exact value you want displayed (including trailing spaces).
Labels assigned using `caption` don't get an automatically incremented number and only apply to the table they are set on.

CAUTION: If you want a space between the label and the title, you must add a trailing space to the value of the caption attribute.

[source#ex-caption]

----
<.> Create an attribute list directly above the table's title and set the named attribute `caption`, followed by an equals sign (`=`), and then a value.
<.> Enclose the value in double quotation marks (`"`).
Otherwise the processor will remove any trailing whitespaces, and the title text will start directly after the last character of the label.

The table from <<ex-caption>> is displayed below.

[caption="Table A. "]
.A table with a custom label
[cols="3*"]
|===
|Null
|A mystery

If you create any subsequent tables in your document and don't set `caption` on them, the title labels will revert to the value assigned to `table-caption`.

If you want the caption of the table to only consist of the caption label, use the following syntax:

[source]
----
[caption=,title='{table-caption} {counter:table-number}']
include::example$table.adoc[tag=b-col-h]
----

Alternately, you can write is as follows:

[source]
----
.{empty}
[caption='{table-caption} {counter:table-number}']
include::example$table.adoc[tag=b-col-h]
----
