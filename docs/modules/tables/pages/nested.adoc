= Nesting Tables

Table cells marked with the AsciiDoc table style (`a`) support nested tables in addition to normal block content.
To distinguish the inner table from the enclosing one, you need to use `!===` as the table delimiter and a cell separator that differs from that used for the enclosing table.
The default cell separator for a nested table is `!`, though you can choose another character by defining the `separator` attribute on the table.

NOTE: Although nested tables are not technically valid in DocBook 5.0, the DocBook toolchain processes them anyway.

The following example contains a nested table in the last cell.
Notice the nested table has its own format, independent of that of the outer table:

[source]
----
include::example$table.adoc[tag=nested]
----

.Result: A nested table
include::example$table.adoc[tag=nested]

We recommend using nested tables sparingly.
There's usually a better way to present the information.
