= Assign a Role to a Table

Like with all blocks, you can add a role to a table using the `role` attribute.
The role attribute becomes a CSS class when converted to HTML.
The preferred shorthand for assigning the role attribute is to put the role name in the first position of the block attribute list prefixed with a `.` character, as shown here:
