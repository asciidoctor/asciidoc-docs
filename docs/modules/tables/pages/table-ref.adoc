.4+|format
.4+|data format of the table's contents
|psv

|cells are delimited by a colon (`:`) (aka delimiter-separated values)

|csv
|cells are delimited by a comma (`,`) (aka comma-separated values)

|tsv
|cells are delimited by a tab character (aka tab-separated values)

.3+|separator
.3+|character used to separate cells
|{vbar}
|default for top-level tables
.3+|
|!
|default for nested tables
d|user-defined
|any single character or `\t` for tab (e.g., `{brvbar}` or `%`).
_Ideally a character not found in the cell content._

.4+|frame
.4+|draws a border around the table
|all
|border on all sides (default)
.4+|

|ends
|border on top and bottom ends

|none
|no borders

|sides
|border on left and right sides

.4+|grid
.4+|draws boundary lines between rows and columns
|all
|draws boundary lines around each cell (default)
.4+|

|cols
|draws boundary lines between columns

|rows

.3+|align
.3+|horizontally aligns a table with restricted width
|left
|aligns to left side of page (default)
.3+|Not recognized by Asciidoctor.
To align the table, use an alignment role (e.g., `[role=center]` or `[.center]`).
The alignment roles work for both HTML and PDF output.
Alignment roles and the `float` attributes are mutually exclusive.

|right
|aligns to right side of page

|center
|horizontally aligns to center of page

.2+|float
.2+|floats the table to the specified side of the page
|left
|floats the table to the left side of the page (default)
.2+|Applies to HTML output only.
Must be used in conjunction with the table's `width` attribute to take effect.
The `float` and `align` attributes are mutually exclusive.

|right
|floats the table to the right side of the page

.3+|halign
.3+|horizontally aligns all of the cell contents in a table
|left
|aligns the contents of the cells to the left (default)
.3+|Not recognized by Asciidoctor.
Define instead using column or cell specifiers (e.g., `3*>`), which take precedence over this value.

|right
|aligns the contents of the cells to the right

|center
|aligns the contents to the cell centers

.3+|valign
.3+|vertically aligns all of the cell contents in a table
|top
|aligns the cell contents to the top of the cell (default)
.3+|Not recognized by Asciidoctor.
Define instead using column or cell specifiers (e.g., `3*.>`), which take precedence over this value.

|bottom
|aligns the cell contents to the bottom of the cell

|middle
|aligns the cell contents to the middle of the cell

|orientation
|rotates the table
|landscape
|rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise
|Equivalent to setting the rotate option, which is preferred.
DocBook only.

.6+|options
.6+|comma separated list of option names
|header
|promotes first row to the table header
.2+d|header and footer rows are omitted by default

|footer
|promotes last row to the table footer

|breakable
|allows the table to split across a page (default)
.2+d|Mutually exclusive.
DocBook only (specifically for generating PDF output).

|unbreakable
|prevents the table from being split across a page

|autowidth
|disables explicit column widths (ignores distribution ratios in `cols` attribute)
|

|rotate
|Prints the table in landscape
d|Equivalent to setting the orientation to landscape.
DocBook only.

.4+|role
.4+|comma-separated list of role names
|left
|floats the table to the left margin

May be specified using role shorthand (e.g., `[.center]`).

|right
|floats the table to the right

|center
|aligns the table to center

|stretch
|stretches an autowidth table to the width of the page
