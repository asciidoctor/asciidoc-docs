= Table Width

By default, a table will span the width of the content area.

== Fixed width

To constrain the width of the table to a fixed value, set the `width` attribute in the table's attribute list.
The width is an integer percentage value ranging from 1 to 100.
The `%` sign is optional.

.Table with width set to 75%
[source#ex-fixed]
----
[width=75%]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]
----

.Result of <<ex-fixed>>
[width=75%]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]

== Autowidth

Alternately, you can make the width fit the content by setting the `autowidth` option.
The columns inherit this setting, so individual columns will also be sized according to the content.

.Table using autowidth
[source#ex-auto]
----
[%autowidth]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]
----

.Result of <<ex-auto>>
[%autowidth]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]

If you want each column to have an automatic width, but want the table to span the width of the content area, add the `stretch` role to the table.
(Alternatively, you can set the `width` attribute to `100%`.)

.Full-width table with autowidth columns
[source#ex-stretch]
----
[%autowidth.stretch]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]
----

The table from <<ex-stretch>> is rendered below.
The columns are sized to the content, but the table spans the width of the page.

.Result of <<ex-stretch>>
[%autowidth.stretch]
include::example$row.adoc[tag=base-h]

WARNING: The `autowidth` option is not recognized by the DocBook converter.

== Mix fixed and autowidth columns

If you want to apply `autowidth` only to certain columns, use the special value `~` as the width of the column.
In this case, width values are assumed to be a percentage value (i.e., 100-based).

.Table with fixed and autowidth columns
[source#ex-mix]
----
[cols="25h,~,~"]
|===
|small |as big as the column needs to be |the rest
|===
----

.Result of <<ex-mix>>
[cols="25h,~,~"]
|===
|small |as big as the column needs to be |the rest
|===
