= Number Special Sections

Sections that are assigned a built-in special style aren't numbered by default.
To number regular sections as well as special sections, set `sectnums` and assign it a value of `all`.

:sectnums: all

The assignment of appendix numbers isn't affected by `sectnums` as their section title prefixes are controlled by the attribute xref:appendix.adoc#caption[appendix-caption].
Book parts aren't numbered by `sectnums` either, instead, they're xref:part-numbers-and-labels.adoc[controlled by `partnums`].
