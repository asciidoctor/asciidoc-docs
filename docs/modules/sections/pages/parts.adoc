= Book Parts

Parts can only be used when the document type is `book`.
There is no dedicated `doctype` for a multi-part book to distinguish it from a regular book.
That distinction is made by the section levels you use.

== Part section level syntax

Parts are specified by a level 0 section (`=`).
Each part must contain at least one section.
You can insert optional introduction content beneath in the part section prior to the first section.
Additionally, there are attributes devoted especially to xref:part-numbers-and-labels.adoc[numbering and labeling parts].

== Special sections for parts

A part can have its own xref:preface.adoc[preface], xref:bibliography.adoc[bibliography], xref:glossary.adoc[glossary] and xref:index.adoc[index].
