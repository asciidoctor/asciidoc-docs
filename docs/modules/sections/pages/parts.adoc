= Book Parts

Parts can only be used when the document type is `book`.
The presence of at least one part implies that the document is a multi-part book.
(There's no dedicated `doctype` for a multi-part book to distinguish it from a book with only chapters).

== Anatomy of a part

A part is a level 0 section.
A part must contain at least one level 1 section.
The first part is the first level 0 section in the document that comes after the document title.
Like the document title, a part is designated by a level 0 section title (`=`).

include::example$part.adoc[tag=basic]

A part can have an optional introduction (similar to the preamble of the document), known as a part intro.
The part intro is the content between the part title and the first section in the part.
The part intro can be marked explicitly using the `partintro` style on either a paragraph or open block.

AsciiDoc provides document attributes to control the xref:part-numbers-and-labels.adoc[numbering and labeling parts].

== Part intro

The content between the part title and the first section in the part is the part intro.
Normally, the part intro is inferred, as shown here:

-----
include::example$part.adoc[tags=**;!style]
-----

You can mark the part intro explicitly by adding the `partintro` style on the sole block before the first section.

-----
include::example$part.adoc[tags=**]
-----

== Special sections for parts

A part can have its own xref:preface.adoc[preface], xref:bibliography.adoc[bibliography], xref:glossary.adoc[glossary] and xref:user-index.adoc[index].

== Special sections as part siblings

In a multipart book, parts occupy the top level of the hierarchy.
If you define a special section at level 1 that follows the parts in a multipart book, it will become a child of the last part.
If, instead, you want the special section to be a sibling, it has to be part-like, meaning it must be defined as as a level 0 section.
To be consistent, it's best to do the same for special sections that come before parts, though technically the syntax doesn't require it.

The AsciiDoc syntax allows special sections in a multipart book to be defined using a level 0 section title (i.e., `=`).
When the document is parsed, these sections still end up as level 1 sections.
Despite this level change, they remain siblings of parts in the hierarchy.
If the special section supports nested sections, the next level must be level 2 (i.e., `===`), since the special section itself has level 1.

Here's an example of a multi-part book that has a special section before and after the part.

When you convert this document, notice that the special sections are siblings of the part in the table of contents.
