Unless you specify a custom ID for a section, Asciidoctor automatically generates an ID from the section's title and assigns it to the section.

== How a section ID is assembled

Asciidoctor builds an ID from a section title using the following order of events and rules:

* Inline formatting is applied (in title substitution order).
* All characters are converted to lowercase.
* The value of the xref:id-prefix-and-separator.adoc#prefix[idprefix attribute] (`+_+` by default) is prepended.
* Character references, HTML/XML tags, and invalid ID characters are removed.
** Refer to the {url-ntname}[NT-Name^] section of the XML specification for a list of valid ID characters.
//** Prior to 1.5.7, HTML/XML tags were not removed and character references and invalid ID characters were replaced with the value of the `idseparator` attribute (`+_+` by default).
* Spaces, hyphens, and periods are replaced with the value of the xref:id-prefix-and-separator.adoc#separator[idseparator attribute] (`+_+` by default)
* Repeating separator characters are condensed.
* If necessary, a sequence number is appended until the ID is unique within the document.

For example, the section title `Wiley & Sons, Inc.` produces the ID `_wiley_sons_inc`.
You can toggle ID autogeneration on and off using `sectids` and xref:id-prefix-and-separator.adoc[customize the ID prefix and word separator].

[#disable]
== Disable section ID generation

To disable the autogeneration of section IDs, unset the `sectids` attribute.

If you disable autogenerated section IDs, and you don't assign a custom ID to a section, you won't be able to create cross references to that section.
xref:custom-ids.adoc[Custom section IDs] are still used even when autogenerated section IDs are disabled.
