= Hide Special Section Titles

CAUTION: This feature is only available in the DocBook converter.

The titles of xref:styles.adoc[special sections], such as the Dedication, can be turned off by assigning `untitled` to the section's options attribute (`%` or `options=untitled`).

[source]
----
[dedication%untitled]
== Dedication

include::example$multi-special.adoc[tag=dedicate]
----

The section still needs a title in the source, otherwise you can't assign the special section style to it or link to the section with a cross reference.
