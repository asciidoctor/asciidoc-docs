[#part-signifier]

The label _Part_ is automatically added to the beginning of the part titles when the `partnums` attribute is set.
You can modify the label by defining the `part-signifier` attribute in the header of your book.

The `part-signifier` value should be followed by a space to separate the autogenerated number from the label.
