[#chapter-label]
== Chapter labels

CAUTION: The chapter-label attribute is only available in the Asciidoctor PDF converter.

When using Asciidoctor PDF and the document type is `book`, level 1 section titles (`==`) are automatically labeled with _Chapter_, then the autogenerated chapter number, followed by the title.
For example:

 Chapter 1: Title

You can modify the chapter label by defining the `chapter-label` attribute.

[source]
----
:chapter-label: Peat√ºkk
----

The `chapter-label` value should be followed by a space to separate the autogenerated number from the label.
To remove the label, unset the attribute (`:chapter-label!:`).
