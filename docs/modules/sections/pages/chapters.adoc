[#chapter-signifier]
== Customize the chapter signifier

If the `chapter-signifier` (i.e., prefix) is set, the value of this attribute is automatically added to the beginning of chapter titles in a book when the `sectnums` attribute is also set.
The signifier is offset from the auto-generated chapter number by a space.
For example, the chapter title may appear in the output document as follows:

 Chapter 1. Title

A chapter is defined as a level-1 section without a block style when the doctype type is book.
You can modify the signifier by defining the `chapter-signifier` attribute in the header of your book.

----
:chapter-signifier: Peat√ºkk
----

To remove the prefix, unset the `chapter-signifier` attribute in the document header:

----
:!chapter-signifier:
----
