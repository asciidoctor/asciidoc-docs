[#part-signifier]
== Customize the part signifier

The signifier (i.e., prefix) _Part_ is automatically added to the beginning of the part titles when the `partnums` attribute is set.
The signifier is offset from the auto-generated part number by a space.
You can modify the signifier by defining the `part-signifier` attribute in the header of your book.
