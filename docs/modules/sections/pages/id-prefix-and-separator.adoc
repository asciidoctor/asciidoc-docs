= Change the ID Prefix and Separator

When Asciidoctor runs, it prefixes xref:ids.adoc[autogenerated section IDs] with an underscore and separates each word with an underscore.
These characters can be customized with the `idprefix` and `idseparator` attributes.

[#prefix]
== Change the ID prefix

By default, Asciidoctor prefixes autogenerated section IDs with an underscore (`+_+`).
You can change this prefix by setting the `idprefix` attribute and assigning it a new value.
The value of `idprefix` must begin with a valid ID start character and can have any number of additional valid ID characters.

----
:idprefix: id_
----

If you want to remove the prefix, set the attribute to an empty value.

[source]
----
:idprefix:
----

WARNING: If you set the `idprefix` to empty, you could end up generating IDs that are invalid in DocBook output (e.g., an ID that begins with a number) or that match a built-in ID in the HTML output (e.g., `header`).
In this case, we recommend either using a non-empty value of `idprefix` or assigning xref:custom-ids.adoc[explicit IDs to your sections].

[#separator]
== Change the ID word separator

The default section ID word separator is an underscore (`+_+`).
You can change the separator with the `idseparator` attribute.
Unless empty, the value of the `idseparator` must be _exactly one valid ID character_.

----
:idseparator: -
----

If you don't want to use a separator, set the attribute to an empty value.

:idseparator:

NOTE: When a document is rendered on GitHub, the `idprefix` is set to an empty value and the `idseparator` is set to `-`.
These settings are used to ensure that the IDs generated by GitHub match the IDs generated by Asciidoctor.
