= Subscript and Superscript

Subscript and superscript text is common in mathematical expressions and chemical formulas.
When rendered, the size of subscripted and superscripted text is reduced.
Subscripted text is placed at the baseline and superscripted text above the baseline.
The size and precise placement of the text depends on the font and other stylesheet parameters applied to the converted document.

== Subscript and superscript syntax

Text is subscripted when you enclose it in a pair of tildes (`{tilde}`) and superscripted with a pair of carets (`{caret}`)

Subscript:: One tilde (`{tilde}`) on either side of a word or phrase makes it subscript.
Superscript:: One caret (`{caret}`) on either side of a word or phrase makes it superscript.
