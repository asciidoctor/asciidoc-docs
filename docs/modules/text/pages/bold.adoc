= Bold
// content written and moved upstream from Antora by @graphitefriction

Text that is marked up as bold will stand out against the regular, surrounding text due to the application of a thicker and/or darker font.
Bold is useful when the text needs to catch the attention of a site visitor quickly scanning a page.

== Bold syntax

You can mark a word or phrase as bold by enclosing it in a single pair of asterisks (e.g., `+*word*+`) (constrained).
You can mark bounded characters (i.e., characters within a word) as bold by enclosing them in a pair of double asterisks (e.g., `+char**act**ers+`) (unconstrained).

A bold *word*, and a bold *phrase of text*.

You don't need to use double asterisks when an entire word or phrase marked as bold is directly followed by a common punctuation mark, such as `;`, `"`, and `!`.

== Mixing bold with other formatting

You can add multiple emphasis styles to bold text as long as the syntax is placed in the correct order.
