//Partitioning Large Documents and using leveloffset
// [#include-partitioning]

When your document gets large, you can split it up into subdocuments for easier editing.

----
= My book

\include::chapter01.adoc[]

\include::chapter02.adoc[]

\include::chapter03.adoc[]
----

TIP: Note the blank lines before and after the include directives.
This practice is recommended whenever including AsciiDoc content to avoid unexpected results (e.g., a section title getting interpreted as a line at the end of a previous paragraph).

== Manipulate heading levels with leveloffset

The `leveloffset` attribute can help here by pushing all headings in the included document down by the specified number of levels.
This allows you to publish each chapter as a standalone document (complete with a document title), but still be able to include the chapters into a primary document (which has its own document title).

You can easily assemble your book so that the chapter document titles become level 1 headings using:

----
= My Book

\include::chapter01.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

\include::chapter02.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

\include::chapter03.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

Because the leveloffset is _relative_ (it begins with + or -), this works even if the included document has its own includes and leveloffsets.

If you have lots of chapters to include and want them all to have the same offset, you can save some typing by setting `leveloffset` around the includes:

[source]
----
= My book

:leveloffset: +1

\include::chapter01.adoc[]

\include::chapter02.adoc[]

\include::chapter03.adoc[]

:leveloffset: -1
----

The final line returns the level offset to 0.

Alternatively, you could use absolute levels:

[source]
----
:leveloffset: 1

//includes

:leveloffset: 0
----

Relative levels are preferred.
Absolute levels become awkward when you have nested includes since they aren't context aware.

////
That's also why it's important to surround the include directive by blank lines if it imports in a discrete structure.

You only want to place include files directly adjacent to one another if the imported content should be directly adjacent.

IMPORTANT: Take note of the blank lines between the include directives.
The blank line between include directives prevents the first and last lines of the included files from being adjoined.
This practice is *strongly* encouraged when combining document parts.
If you don't include these blank lines, you might find that the AsciiDoc processor swallows section titles.
This happens because the leading section title can get interpreted as the last line of the final paragraph in the preceding include.
Only place include directives on consecutive lines if the intent is for the includes to run together (such as in a listing block).
