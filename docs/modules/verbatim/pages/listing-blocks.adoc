= Listing Blocks
:replace-me: I've been replaced!

Blocks and paragraphs assigned the `listing` style display their rendered content exactly as you enter it.
Listing content is converted to preformatted text (i.e., `<pre>`).
The content is shown in a fixed-width font and endlines are preserved.
It's only subject to xref:subs:special-characters.adoc[special character] and callout substitutions.

The listing style can be applied to content using any of the following methods:

* indenting the first line of a paragraph by one or more spaces,
* setting the `listing` style on a block or paragraph using an attribute list, or
* enclosing the content within a pair of listing block delimiters (`----`).

== Indent method

When a line begins with one or more spaces it is displayed as a listing block.
This method is an easy way to insert simple code snippets.

.Indicate listing content using an indent
[#ex-indent]
----
include::example$listing.adoc[tag=indent]
----

The result of <<ex-indent>> is rendered below.

include::example$listing.adoc[tag=indent]

== Listing style syntax

The block style `listing` can be applied to a block or paragraph, by setting the attribute `listing` using an attribute list.

include::example$listing.adoc[tag=style]

The result of <<ex-style>> is rendered below.

include::example$listing.adoc[tag=style]

== Delimited listing block

A delimited listing block is surrounded by lines composed of four hyphens (`----`).
This method is useful when the content contains blank lines.

[#ex-block]
------
include::example$listing.adoc[tag=block]

Here's how the block in <<ex-block>> appears when rendered.

// The listing style must be added above the rendered block so it is rendered correctly because we're setting `source-language` in the component descriptor which automatically promotes unstyled listing blocks to source blocks.
[listing]
include::example$listing.adoc[tag=block]

You should notice a few things about how the content is processed.

* The HTML element `<pre>` is escaped, that is, it's displayed verbatim, not interpreted.
* The endlines are preserved.
* The phrase _delimited listing block_ isn't italicized, despite having the underscore formatting marks around it.

Listing blocks are good for displaying snippets of raw source code, especially when used in tandem with the `source` style and `source-highlighter` attribute.
See xref:source-blocks.adoc[] to learn more about `source` and `source-highlighter`.

== Listing substitutions

Content that is assigned the `listing` style, either via the explicit block style or the listing delimiters is subject to the xref:subs:substitutions.adoc#verbatim-group[verbatim substitution group].
Only xref:subs:special-characters.adoc[special characters] and callouts are replaced automatically in listing content.

You can control the substitutions applied to a listing block using the `subs` attribute.

This is a _delimited listing block_

the incremental value `+attributes`.
This attribute reference:

will be replaced with the attribute's
value when rendered.
