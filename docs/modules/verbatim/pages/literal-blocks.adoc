= Literal Blocks

Literal blocks display the text you write exactly as you see it in the source.
Literal text is treated as preformatted text.
The text is presented in a fixed-width font and endlines are preserved.
Only xref:subs:special-characters.adoc[special characters] and callouts are replaced when the document is converted.

The literal style can be applied to content using any of the following methods:

* indenting the first line of a paragraph by one or more spaces,
* setting the `literal` style on a block using an attribute list, or
* enclosing the content within a pair of literal block delimiters (`\....` ).

== Indent method

When a line begins with one or more spaces it is displayed as a literal block.
This method is an easy way to insert simple code snippets.

.Indicate literal text using an indent
[source#ex-indent]

include::example$literal.adoc[tag=indent]

The result of <<ex-indent>> is rendered below.

=== literal style syntax

The literal style can be applied to a block, such as a paragraph, by setting the style attribute `literal` on the block using an attribute list.

=== Delimited literal block

Finally, you can surround the content you want rendered as literal by enclosing it in a pair of literal block delimiters (`\....`).
This method is useful when the content contains empty lines.

.Delimited literal block syntax
[source#ex-block]
----
include::example$literal.adoc[tag=block]

The result of <<ex-block>> is rendered below.

include::example$literal.adoc[tag=block]

Notice in the output that the bold text formatting is not applied to the text nor are the three consecutive periods replaced by the ellipsis Unicode character.
