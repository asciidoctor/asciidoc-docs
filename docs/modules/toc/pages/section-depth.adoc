:navtitle: Change the Section Level Depth

You can adjust the depth of section levels that are displayed in the table of contents with the `toclevels` attribute.

== Set toclevels

By default, the TOC displays level 1 (`==`) and level 2 (`===`) section titles.
You can assign a different level depth with the `toclevels` attribute.

.Define toclevels value
[source#ex-levels]
----
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=header]
:toc: <.>
:toclevels: 4 <.>
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=body]
----
<.> The `toc` attribute must be set in order to use `toclevels`.
<.> `toclevels` is set and assigned the value `4` in the document header.
The TOC will list the titles of any sections, levels 1 through 4 (i.e., `==` through `=====`), when the document is rendered.

The result of <<ex-levels>> is displayed below.
