= Automatic Table of Contents

A table of contents (TOC) is an index of section titles that is automatically generated from the document's structure.

== Activate the TOC

To enable the autogenerated TOC, set the `toc` document attribute.
The `toc` attribute is activated with an attribute entry in the document header.

.Enable TOC with the toc attribute
[source#ex-default]
----
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=header]
:toc: <.>
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=body]
----
<.> Set the `toc` attribute in the header using an attribute entry.
When the value of `toc` is left blank, the processor will use the attribute's default value.

By default, the TOC is rendered directly below the document header, is titled _Table of Contents_, and contains section 1 and section 2 level titles only.
The result of <<ex-default>> is displayed below.

You can customize the xref:title.adoc[title of the TOC], the xref:section-depth.adoc[depth of the section levels], and the xref:position.adoc[position of the TOC in the document].
However, not all of the attributes are supported by all converters.
See xref:toc-ref.adoc[] for which attributes are available to each converter.

== Activate the TOC from the CLI

The `toc` attribute can also be specified via the command line (`-a toc`).

.TOC enabled via the CLI
 $ asciidoctor -a toc my-document.adoc
