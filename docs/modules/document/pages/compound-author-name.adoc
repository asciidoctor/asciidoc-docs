= Compound Author Names

When a name consists of multiple parts, such as a compound or composite surname, or a double middle name, the processor needs to be explicitly told which words should be assigned to a specific attribute.

== Connecting compound author names

If the parts of an author's name aren't assigned to the correct built-in attributes, they may output the wrong information if they're referenced in the body of the document.
For instance, if the name _Ann Marie Jenson_ was entered on the author line or assigned to the attribute `author`, the processor would assign _Ann_ to `firstname`, _Marie_ to `middlename`, and _Jenson_ to `lastname` based on the location and order of each word.
This assignment would be incorrect because the author's first name is _Ann Marie_.

When part of an author's name consists of more than one word, use an underscore (`+_+`) between the words to connect them.

== Compound names in the author line

In <<ex-line-compound>>, the first author has a compound first name and the second author has a compound surname.

<.> To signal to the processor that _Ann Marie_ is the author's first name (instead of their first and middle names), type an underscore (`+_+`) between each part of the author's first name.
<.> The second author's last name consists of three words.
Type an underscore (`+_+`) between each word of the author's last name.

The result of <<ex-line-compound>> is displayed below.
Notice that the underscores (`+_+`) aren't displayed when the document is rendered.

The underscore between each word in a compound name ensures that the parts of an author's name are assigned correctly to the corresponding built-in attributes.
If you were to reference the first author's first name or the second author's last name in the document body, as shown in <<ex-reference-compound>>, the correct values would be displayed.

== Compound names in the author attribute

An underscore (`+_+`) should also be placed between each part of a compound name when the author is assigned using the `author` attribute.

{firstname} lives on the Bellarine Peninsula near Geelong, Australia. <.>
----
<.> Assign the author's name to the `author` attribute.
Enter an underscore (`+_+`) between each part of the author's first name.
This ensures that their full first name is correct when it's automatically assigned to `firstname` by the processor.
<.> The built-in attribute `firstname` is referenced in the document's body.
The author's first name is automatically extracted from the value of `author` and assigned to `firstname`.

The result of <<ex-compound>>, displayed below, shows that the processor assigned the correct words to the built-in attribute `firstname` since the author's full first name, _Mara Moss_, is displayed where `firstname` was referenced.
