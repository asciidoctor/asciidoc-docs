= Reference the Revision Attributes

You can reference the revision information attributes in your document regardless of whether they're set via the revision line or attribute entries.

[#reference-revnumber]
== Reference revnumber

Remember, when `revnumber` is assigned via the revision line, any characters preceding the version number are dropped.
For instance, the revision number in <<ex-line-references>> is prefixed with a _v_.

.Revision line and revision attribute references
[source#ex-line-references]
----
include::example$reference-revision-line.adoc[]
----

The result of <<ex-line-references>> below shows that the _v_ in the version number has been removed when it's rendered in the byline and referenced in the document.

To display the entire value of `revnumber` when it's referenced in the document, you must set and assign it a value using an attribute entry.

.Revision attribute entries and references
[source#ex-references]
----
include::example$reference-revision-attributes.adoc[]
----

The entire value of the `revnumber` from <<ex-references>> is displayed in the byline, including the default `version-label` value _Version_.
When referenced in the document, the entire value of `revnumber` is displayed because it was set with an attribute entry.

If you don't want the default version label to be displayed in the byline, xref:version-label.adoc#unset[unset the version-label attribute].
