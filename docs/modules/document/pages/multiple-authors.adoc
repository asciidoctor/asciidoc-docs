= Add Multiple Authors to a Document

The xref:author-line.adoc[author line] is the only way to assign more than one author to a document for display in the byline.
Additionally, only the HTML 5 and Docbook converters can convert documents with multiple authors.

== Multi-author syntax

The information for each author is concluded with a semicolon (`;`).

.Author line structure for multiple authors
[source]
----
= Document Title
firstname middlename lastname <email>; firstname middlename lastname <email>
----

Directly after each author's last name or optional email, enter a semicolon (`;`) followed by a blank space, and then enter the next author's information.

== List multiple authors on the author line

The author line in <<ex-line-multiple>> lists the information for three authors.
Each author's information is separated by a semicolon (`;`).
Notice that the author _B. Steppenwolf_ doesn't have an email, so the semicolon is placed at the end of their name.

.An author line with three authors and two email addresses
[source#ex-line-multiple]
----
include::example$multiple-authors.adoc[tag=header]
----

The result of <<ex-line-multiple>> is displayed below.

The information for each author can also be xref:reference-author-attributes.adoc#reference-multiple-authors[referenced in the document] using their respective built-in attribute.
