= Reference the Author Information

[#reference-author]
== Referencing the author attributes

You can reference the built-in author attributes in your document regardless of whether they're set via the author line or attribute entries.
In <<ex-reference>>, the `author` and `email` attributes are assigned using attribute entries.

.Reference the author attributes

[#reference-multiple-authors]
== Referencing information for multiple authors

The first author in an author line is assigned to the built-in attributes `author`, `email`, `firstname`, etc.
Subsequent authors are assigned to the built-in author attributes, but the attribute names are appended with an underscore (`+_+`) and the numeric position of the author in the author line.
For instance, the author _B. Steppenwolf_ in <<ex-reference-multiple>> is the second author in the author line.
The built-in attributes used to reference their information are appended with the number _2_, e.g., `author_2`, `email_2`, `lastname_2`, etc.

<1> The first author is assigned to the built-in attribute `author`.
<2> The first author's email is assigned to the built-in attribute `email`.
<3> The second author is assigned to the built-in attribute `author_2`.
The underscore (`+_+`) between _Mara_ and _Moss_ tells the processor that the xref:compound-author-name.adoc[author has a double first name].
<4> The second author's email is assigned to the built-in attribute `email_2`.
<5> The third author is assigned to the built-in attribute `author_3`.
<6> The value of an author's email attribute, such as `email_3`, can contain an active URL and link text.
