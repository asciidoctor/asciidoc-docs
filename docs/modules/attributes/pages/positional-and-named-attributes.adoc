= Positional and Named Attributes

This page breaks down the difference between positional and named attributes on an element and the rules for parsing an attribute list.

[#positional]
== Positional attribute

// tag::pos[]
Values placed in a specific order in an attribute list don't require an attribute name.
The attribute that the value is assigned to depends on the type of the element.
Here are some examples:

* `icon:` (1) size
* `image:` and `image::` (1) alt text, (2) width, (3) height
* Delimited blocks: (1) block name (aka style)
* Other inline quoted text: (1) role and ID shorthand
* `link:` and `xref:` (1) link text
* Custom blocks and macros can specify positional attributes

For example, the following two image macros are equivalent.

[source]
----
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,300,400]

image::sunset.jpg[alt=Sunset,width=300,height=400]
----

The second macro is the same as the first, but written out in longhand form.
// end::pos[]

=== Block style and attribute shorthand

The first positional attribute on all blocks (including sections) is special.
It's used to define the xref:blocks:index.adoc#block-style[block style].
It also supports a shorthand syntax for defining the ID, role, and options attributes.
This shorthand syntax can also be used on formatted text, even though formatted text doesn't technically support attributes.

The attribute shorthand is inspired by the HAML and Slim template languages as a way of saving the author some typing.
Instead of having to use the longhand form of a name attribute, it's possible to compress the assignment to a value prefixed by a special marker.
The markers are mapped as follows:

* `#` - ID
* `.` - role
* `%` - option

Each shorthand entry is placed directly adjacent to previous one, starting immediately after the optional block style.
The order of the entries does not matter, except for the style, which must come first.

Here's an example that shows how to set an ID on a section using this shorthand syntax:

----
[#custom-id]
== Section with Custom ID
----

The shorthand entry must follow the block style, if present.
Here's an example that shows how to set an ID on an appendix section using this shorthand syntax:

----
[appendix#custom-id]
== Appendix with Custom ID
----

Here's an example of a block that uses the shorthand syntax to set the ID, a role, and an option for a list.
Specifically, this syntax sets the ID to `rules`, adds the role `prominent`, and sets the option `incremental`.

----
[#rules.prominent%incremental]
* Work hard
* Play hard
* Be happy
----

A block can have multiple roles and options, so these shorthand entries may be repeated.
Here's an example that shows how to set several options on a table.
Specifically, this syntax sets the `header`, `footer`, and `autowidth` options.

----
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
|Header A |Header B
|Footer A |Footer B
|===
----

This shorthand syntax also appears on formatted text.
Here's an example that shows how to set the ID and add a role to a strong phrase.
Specifically, this syntax sets the ID to `free-world` and adds the `goals` role.

----
[#free-world.goals]*free the world*
----

Formatted text does not support a style, so the first and only positional attribute is always the shorthand syntax.

[#named]
== Named attribute

// tag::name[]
A named attribute consists of a name and a value separated by an `=` character (e.g., `name=value`).

If the value contains a space, comma, or quote character, it must be enclosed in double or single quotes (e.g., `name="value with space"`).
In all other cases, the surrounding quotes are optional.
If present, the enclosing quotes are dropped from the parsed value.

If the value contains the same quote character used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `value="the song \"Dark Horse\""`).

[#unset]
=== Unset a named attribute

To undefine a named attribute, set the value to `None` (case sensitive).
// end::name[]

== Attribute list parsing

The source text that's used to define attributes for an element is referred to as an [.term]*attrlist*.
An attrlist is always enclosed in a pair of square brackets.
The processor splits the attrlist into individual attribute entries, determines whether each entry is a positional or named attribute, parses the entry accordingly, and assigns the result as an attribute on the node.

The rules for what defines the boundaries of an individual attribute, and whether the attribute is positional or named, are defined below.
In these rules, a `name` consists of a word character (letter or numeral) followed by any number of word characters, `.` charactes, or `-` characters, followed by something else (including the end of the string)

* Parsing an attribute proceeds from the beginning of the attribute list string or after a previously recognized delimiter (`,`).
* Blank space is skipped.
* If a valid attribute name is found, and it is followed by an equals sign (=), then the parser recognizes this as a named attribute.
The text after the equals sign (=) and up to the next comma or end of list is taken as the attribute value.
Spaces around the equals sign (=) are ignored.
* Otherwise this is a positional attribute with value starting after the skipped blank space and ending before (optional) blank space preceding the next delimiter (`,`).
* To parse the attribute value:
** If the first character is not a quote, the string is read until the next delimiter or end of string.
** If the first character is `"`, then the string is read until the next unescaped quote or, if there is no closing quote, the next delimiter.
If there is a closing quote, the quotes are removed; if not, the initial quote is retained.
** If the next character is `'` then the string is read until the next unescaped `'`, or if there is no closing `'`, the next delimiter.
If there is a closing `'`, the enclosing `'` characters are removed; if not, the initial `'` is retained.
If there is a closing `'` and the first character is not an escaped `'` substitutions are performed as described above.

.When to escape a closing square bracket
****
Since the terminal of an attrlist is a closing square bracket, it's sometimes necessary to escape a closing square bracket if it appears in the value of an attribute.

In line-oriented syntax such as a block attribute list, a block macro, and an include directive, you do not have to escape closing square brackets that appear in the attrlist itself.
That's because the parser already knows to look for the closing square bracket at the end of the line.

If a closing square bracket appears in the attrlist of an inline element, such as an inline macro, it usually has to be escaped using a backslash or by using the character reference `+&#93;+`.
There are some exceptions to this rule, such as a link macro in a footnote, which are influenced by the substitution order.

== Substitutions

// tag::subs[]
Attribute references are expanded before the block attribute list is processed.
Therefore, it's not necessary to force substitutions to be applied if you simply want to use a document attribute reference in a block attribute.

If the attribute name (for a positional attribute) or value (for a named attribute) is enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `+title='Processed by https://asciidoctor.org'+`), normal substitutions are applied to the value at assignment time (with some exceptions).
This is also true for positional attributes, such as the attribution for a quote block.
No special processing is performed, except for attribute reference expansion, if the value is not enclosed in quotes or is enclosed in double quotes.

If the value contains the same quote character used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `+title='A \'use case\' diagram, generated by https://plantuml.com'+`).
// end::subs[]
