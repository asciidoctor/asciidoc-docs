= Element Attributes

Element attributes are a powerful means of controlling the built-in settings of individual block and inline elements.
They're also used to apply user-defined behavior and supplemental information, such as citation information and fallback content, to certain elements.

== What are element attributes?

[.term]*Element attributes* define the built-in and user-defined styles, behavior, and metadata that are applied to an individual block element or inline element in a document.

Element attributes:

* Declare the ID of an element
* Turn on or turn off an individual element's built-in features
* Configure the built-in features of an individual element
* Apply user-defined information, such as citation metadata, fallback text, link text, and target content, to an individual element
* Apply user-defined roles and behaviors to an individual element

Element attributes are classified as positional or named.
They're set and defined directly on the element they're modifying using an attribute list.

== Attribute lists

Attributes are assigned to block and inline elements using an [.term]*attribute list*.

Attribute lists:

* apply to blocks, macros, and inline elements
* can contain xref:positional-and-named-attributes.adoc[positional and named attributes]
* take precedence over xref:document-attributes.adoc[document attributes] (attribute entries)
