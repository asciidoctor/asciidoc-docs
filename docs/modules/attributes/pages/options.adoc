= Options Attribute

The `options` attribute is a versatile xref:positional-and-named-attributes.adoc#named[named attribute] that can be assigned one or more values.
It can be defined globally as document attribute as well as a block attribute on an individual block.

== Assign options to blocks

You can assign one or more options to a block using the shorthand or formal syntax for the `options` attribute.

=== Shorthand options syntax for blocks

To assign an option to a block, prefix the value with a percent sign (`%`) in an attribute list.
The percent sign implicitly sets the `options` attribute.

.Sidebar block with an option assigned using the shorthand dot
[source#ex-block]
----
[%value]
****
This is a sidebar with an option assigned to it.
****
----

You can assign multiple options to a block by prefixing each value with a percent sign (`%`).

.Sidebar with two options assigned using the shorthand dot
[source#ex-two-options]
----
[%value%value]
****
This is a sidebar with two options assigned to it.
****
----

For instance, consider a table with the three built-in option values, `header`, `footer`, and `autowidth`, assigned to it.
<<ex-table-short>> shows how the values are assigned using the shorthand notation.

.Table with three options assigned using the shorthand syntax
[source#ex-table-short]
----
[%header%footer%autowidth,cols=2*~]
|===
|Cell A1 |Cell B1

|Cell A2 |Cell B2

|Cell A3 |Cell B3
|===
----

=== Formal options syntax for blocks

Explicitly set `options` or `opts`, followed by the equals sign (`=`), and then the value in an attribute list.

.Sidebar block with an option assigned using the formal syntax
[source#ex-block-formal]
----
[options="value"]
****
This is a sidebar with an option assigned to it.
****
----

Separate multiple option values with commas (`,`).

.Sidebar with three options assigned using the formal syntax
[source#ex-three-roles-formal]
----
[options="value,value,value"]
****
This is a sidebar with three options assigned to it.
****

Let's revisit the table in <<ex-table-short>> that has the three built-in option values, `header`, `footer`, and `autowidth`, assigned to it using the shorthand notation (`%`).
Instead of using the shorthand notation, <<ex-table-formal>> shows how the values are assigned using the formal syntax.

.Table with three options assigned using the formal syntax
[source#ex-table-formal]
----
[cols=2*~,options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
|Cell A1 |Cell B1

|Cell A2 |Cell B2

|Cell A3 |Cell B3
|===

== Using options with other attributes

Let's consider `options` when combined with other attributes.
The following example shows how to structure an attribute list when you have style, role, and options attributes.

.Shorthand
[source]
----
[horizontal.properties%step] <.> <.> <.>
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----
<.> xref:blocks:styles.adoc[The block style attribute], declared as `horizontal` in this example, is a positional attribute.
A block style value is always placed at the start of the attribute list.
<.> `properties` is prefixed with a dot (`.`), signifying that it's assigned to the xref:roles.adoc[role attribute].
The role and options attributes can be set in either order, i.e., `[horizontal%step.properties]`.
<.> The percent sign (`%`) sets the `options` attribute and assigns the `step` value to it.

When you use the formal syntax, the positional and named attributes are separated by commas (`,`).

.Formal
[source]
----
[horizontal,role="properties", options="step"] <.>
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----
<.> Like in the shorthand example, named attributes such as `role` and `options` can be set in any order in the attribute list once any xref:positional-and-named-attributes.adoc#positional[positional attributes] are set.
