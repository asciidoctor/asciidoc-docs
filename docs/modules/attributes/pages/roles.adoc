== Assign roles to formatted inline elements

You can assign roles to inline elements that are enclosed in formatting syntax, such as bold (`+*+`), italic (`+_+`), and monospace (`++`++`).
To assign a role to an inline element that's enclosed in formatting syntax block, prefix the value with a dot (`.`) in an attribute list.

.Inline role assignments using shorthand syntax
[source#ex-role-dot]
----
This sentence contains [.value]*bold inline content* that's assigned a role.

This sentence contains [.value]`monospace text` that's assigned a role.
----

The HTML source code that is output from <<ex-role-dot>> is shown below.

.HTML source code produced by <<ex-role-dot>>
[source#ex-role-html,html]
----
<p>This sentence contains <strong class="value">bold inline content</strong> that&#8217;s assigned a role.</p>

<p>This sentence contains <code class="value">monospace text</code> that&#8217;s assigned a role.</p>
</div>

////
Using the shorthand notation, an id can also be specified:

[source]
----
[#value.value]`monospace text`
----

which produces:

[source,html]
----
<a id="value"></a><code class="value">monospace text</code>
