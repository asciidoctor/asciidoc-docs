= Document Attributes

You can think of a document attribute as a global variable for the AsciiDoc language.

== What are document attributes?

Document attributes are a powerful text replacement tool and means of controlling built-in settings and behavior for a whole document or regions of a document.

Document attributes:

* Turn on or turn off built-in features
* Configure built-in features
* Declare built-in asset locations
* Hold content for reuse throughout a document

== Types of document attributes

Document attributes fall into the following groups.

Built-in attributes:: Built-in attributes add, configure, and control common features in a document.
Many built-in attributes only take effect when defined in the document header with an attribute entry.

Boolean attributes:: Boolean attributes are a subgroup of the built-in attribute.
They don't have an explicitly assigned value because they act like a toggle.
Their sole function is to turn on or turn off a feature.

User-defined attributes:: #TBA#

== What does setting a document attribute mean?

* be set (turned on)

== What does defining a document attribute mean?

* have default values in the case of built-in attributes
* have no value in the case of boolean attributes and built-in attributes with default values
* have a single line value
* have a value that xref:wrap-values.adoc[spans multiple, contiguous lines]
* have a value that includes basic inline AsciiDoc syntax, such as:
** attribute references
** text formatting (if wrapped in a xref:pass:pass-macro.adoc#inline-pass[pass macro])
** inline macros (if wrapped in a xref:pass:pass-macro.adoc#inline-pass[pass macro])

But there are certain limitations to be aware of.
Document attributes cannot:

* have a value that includes AsciiDoc block content, such as:
** lists
** multiple paragraphs
** blocks (tables, sidebars, examples, etc)
** other whitespace-dependent markup

== What does unsetting a document attribute mean?

* be unset (turned off) with a leading (preferred) or trailing `!` added to the name

== Where are document attributes set, defined, and unset?

Document attributes can be declared in the:

* document header as an xref:attribute-entries.adoc[attribute entry]
* document body as an xref:attribute-entries.adoc[attribute entry]
* API via the `:attributes` option
* CLI via the `-a` option
* override locked attributes assigned from the command line

== What does referencing a document attribute mean?

== Where can document attributes be referenced?

== Handling a missing attribute

If you use an attribute that xref:handle-unresolved-ref.adoc[is not defined], you can specify how an AsciiDoc processor handles attribute reference errors.
