== What is a block?

CAUTION: This is the generic definition and a placeholder.

In an AsciiDoc document, one or more continuous lines of text is defined as a block element.
Examples of block elements are tables, callout lists, block macros such as `image::[]`, verse block titles, paragraphs, an attribute entry in the header, and the header as a whole.
Block elements can be nested within block elements.
