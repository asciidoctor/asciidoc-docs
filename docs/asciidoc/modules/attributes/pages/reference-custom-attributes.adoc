You'll likely use the value of a user-defined attribute entry or certain built-in attributes in specific locations throughout a document.
To reference and use the value of a document attribute, you enclose the attribute's name in curly brackets (`+{name-of-an-attribute}+`).
This inline element is called an *attribute reference*.

== Reference user-defined attributes

Before you can reference an attribute in a document it must be declare using an attribute entry in the document header.
Let's reference the two user-defined attributes set and assigned values in <<ex-user-attrs>>.

.User-defined document attributes set in the document header
[source#ex-user-attrs]

:url-repo: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor
----

Once you've set and assigned a value to the attribute, you can reference that attribute throughout your document.
In <<ex-reference>>, the attribute `url-repo` is referenced twice and `disclaimer` is referenced once.

.User-defined attribute referenced in the document body
[source#ex-reference]
----
Asciidoctor is {url-repo}[open source]. <.>

WARNING: {disclaimer} <.>
If you're missing a lime colored sock, file a ticket in
the {url-repo}/issues[Asciidoctor issue tracker]. <.>
----
<.> Attribute references can be used in macros.
<.> Attribute references can be used in blocks, such as xref:blocks:admonition.adoc[admonitions], and inline.
Since there isn't a blank line between the `disclaimer` reference and the next sentence, the sentence will be directly appended to the end of the attribute's value when it's processed.
<.> The reference to the `url-repo-ex` attribute is inserted into a longer URL address and used in a xref:macros:url-macro.adoc[URL macro].

As you can see below, the attribute references are replaced with the corresponding attribute value when the document is processed.

====
Asciidoctor is {url-repo}[open source].

To save even more typing, you can store the whole link in an attribute value.

.Link attribute entry
[source]
----
:link-fedpkg: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor[Asciidoctor package for Fedora]
----

Now you insert this link anywhere in the document using an attribute reference.

.link-fedpkg attribute usage example
[source]
----
Did you know there's an {link-fedpkg}?
----

Note that the link substitution occurs _after_ the attribute reference is resolved.
This works thanks to the default order of substitutions on a paragraph.
If you want the URL macro to be resolved eagerly at the time the attribute is assigned, you need to enclose it in a pass macro.

.Link attribute entry resolved eagerly
[source]
----
:link-fedpkg: pass:m[https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor[Asciidoctor package for Fedora]]
----

Now you can use this link in a section title (where the order of substitutions is different).
