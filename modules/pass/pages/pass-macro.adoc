= Inline Passthroughs
//um anchor: pass-macros

Asciidoctor supports several inline passthrough macros.

== Inline passthrough macros

[[def-plus]]single and double plus:: A special syntax for preventing inline text from being formatted.
Only xref:subs:special-characters.adoc[special characters] are replaced in the output format.
The substitutions can't be modified for this type of passthrough.

triple plus:: A special inline syntax for designating passthrough content.
No substitutions are applied nor can they be added using the step and group substitution values.

inline pass macro:: An inline macro named `pass` that can be used to passthrough content.
You can apply specific substitutions to the macro's target using substitution types and groups.

pass:[content like #{variable} passed directly to the output] followed by normal content.

content with only select substitutions applied: pass:c,a[__<{email}>__]
----

TIP: When you need to prevent or control the substitutions on one or more blocks of content, use a xref:pass-block.adoc[delimited passthrough block or the pass block style].

[#triple-plus]
== Triple plus macro

The triple plus passthrough excludes content enclosed in a pair of triple pluses (pass:[+++]) from all substitutions.

 +++content passed directly to the output+++ followed by normal content.

The triple plus macro is often used to output custom HTML or XML.

[#inline-pass]
== Inline pass macro

To exclude inline content from all of the substitutions, enclose it in the inline pass macro.
For example, here's one way to format text as underline when generating HTML from AsciiDoc:

WARNING: Using passthroughs to pass content (without substitutions) can couple your content to a specific output format, such as HTML.
In these cases, you should use conditional preprocessor directives to route passthrough content for different output formats based on the current backend.

The inline pass macro is the only macro that is processed in the document header as part of the xref:subs:substitutions.adoc#header-group[header substitution group].

== Nesting blocks and passthroughs

When you're using passthroughs inside literal and listing blocks, it can be easy to forget that the single plus and triple plus passthroughs are xref:subs:macros.adoc[macros substitutions].
To enable the passthroughs, assign the `macros` value to the `subs` attribute.
