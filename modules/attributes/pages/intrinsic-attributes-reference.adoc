= Intrinsic Attributes Reference
:url-epoch: https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch

The AsciiDoc processor automatically assigns values to various document attributes whenever a document is loaded or converted.
These _intrinsic attributes_ provide information about the document being processed (e.g., `docfile`), the security mode under which the processor is running (e.g., `safe-mode-name`), and some information about the user's environment (e.g., `user-home`).
Like all document attributes, the value of an intrinsic attributes can be accessed using an attribute reference.
Many of these attributes are intended to be read only.

|backend
|The backend used to select and activate the converter that creates the output file.
Usually named according to the output format (e.g., `html5`)
|html5

|basebackend
|The generic backend on which the backend is based.
Typically the backend value minus any trailing numbers (e.g., the basebackend for `docbook5` is `docbook`).
May also indicate the internal backend employed by the converter (e.g., the basebackend for `pdf` is `html`).

[[note_docdatetime]]^[1]^ Only reflects the last modified time of the source document file.
It does not consider the last modified time of files which are included.

[[note_sourcedateepoch]]^[2]^ If the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable is set, the value assigned to this attribute is built from a UTC date object that corresponds to the timestamp (as an integer) stored in that environment variable.
This override offers one way to make the conversion reproducible.
See the {url-epoch}[source date epoch specification] for more information about the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable.
Otherwise, the date is expressed in the local time zone, which is reported as a time zone offset (e.g., `-0600`) or UTC if the time zone offset is 0).
To force the use of UTC, set the `TZ=UTC` environment variable when invoking Asciidoctor.
