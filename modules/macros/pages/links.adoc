:url-url-def: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL

AsciiDoc offers a variety of ways of creating links (aka hyperlinks) to addressable resources.
The pages in this section document how to add and customize links in an AsciiDoc document.

== URLs and links

The target of a link is a {url-url-def}[Uniform Resource Locator^] (URL), otherwise known as a web address.
The text you click to be navigate to that target is referred to as the link text.

NOTE: You may sometimes see the term URI used in place of a URL.
Although the URI is more technically correct in some cases, URL is the accepted term.

A URL consists of a scheme, an authority (i.e., domain name), a path with optional file extension, and metadata in the form of a query string and fragment.
You may recognize the URL as what you type in the location bar of a web browser (such as the one for this page).

Since a URL has a distinct, recognizable syntax, an AsciiDoc processor will detect them (unless escaped) wherever the macro substitution step is applied and automatically convert them into links.
This also works for bare email addresses.
You can learn more about this behavior in xref:autolinks.adoc[].

== Link-related macros

Instead of showing the bare URL or email address as the link text, you may want to customize that text.
Or perhaps you want to apply attributes to the link, such as a role.
To do so, you'd use either the xref:url-macro.adoc[URL macro] or, if you're linking to xref:complex-urls.adoc[a complex URL], the more explicit xref:link-macro.adoc[link macro].

You can also use the xref:link-macro.adoc[link macro] to make a link to a target that is not recognized as a URL, such as a relative path.

When linking to an email address, you can use the specialized xref:email-macro.adoc[email macro] to enhance the link with prepopulated subject and body text.

[#hide-uri-scheme]
== Hide the URL scheme

If the link text is a bare URL (aka URI), whether that link was created automatically or using a link-related macro, you can configure the AsciiDoc processor to hide the scheme (e.g., _https://_).
Hiding the scheme can make the URL more readable--perhaps even recognizable--to a person less familiar with technical nomenclature.

To configure the AsciiDoc processor to display the linked URL without the scheme part, set the `hide-uri-scheme` attribute in the header of the AsciiDoc document.

<.> Note the use of `uri` instead of `url` in the attribute name.

When the `hide-uri-scheme` attribute is set, the above URL will be displayed to the reader as follows:

====
https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org]
====

Note the absence of _https://_ in the URL.
The prefix will still be present in the link target.

= URLs and Links

A Uniform Resource Link (URL) represents the location of a resource on the web.
Typical URLs contain a scheme, domain name, file name, and extension.

#move image#
//image::url.png[]

// tag::basic[]
Asciidoctor recognizes the following common schemes without the help of any markup.

[#schemes]
* http
* https
* ftp
* irc
* mailto
* \email@email.com

You can think of these schemas as implicit macro names (with the exception of a bare email address).
Since the URL in the example below begins with a protocol (in this case _https_ followed by a colon), Asciidoctor will automatically turn it into a hyperlink when it is processed.
We call this a URL macro.

include::example$url.adoc[tag=base-co]

<.> The trailing period will not get caught up in the link.

To prevent automatic linking of an URL, prepend it with a backslash (`\`).

[source]
----
Once launched, the site will be available at \https://example.org.

== Link text

To attach a URL to text, enclose the text in square brackets at the end of the URL, thus making it a URL macro.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=irc]
----
// end::basic[]

Additionally, you can format the link text.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=text]
----

.Rendered URLs
====
include::example$url.adoc[tag=base]

You may also want to append empty square brackets to force the URL to be parsed when it would not normally be recognized, such as if it's enclosed in double quotes:

[source]
----
Type "https://asciidoctor.org[]" into the location bar of your browser.
----

== The link macro

// tag::link[]
When a URL does not start with one of the <<schemes,common schemes>>, or the URL is not surrounded by word boundaries, you must use the `link` macro.
The `link` macro is a stronger version of a URI macro, which you can think of like an unconstrained macro.
The URL is preceded by `link:` and followed by square brackets.
The square brackets may include optional link text.
The URL is used for the text of the link if link text is not specified.
Prior to 1.5.7, if the `linkattrs` document attribute is set, the text in square brackets is parsed as attributes, which allows a window name or role to be specified.
Since 1.5.7, attributes are parsed automatically if an equal sign is found after a comma (e.g., `[link text,window=_blank]`).

.Anatomy of a link macro

link:url[optional link text, optional target attribute, optional role attribute]
----

Let's consider a case where we need to use the link macro (instead of just a URI macro) to expand a link when it's not adjacent to a word boundary (i.e., unconstrained).

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=unconstrained]
----

====
include::example$url.adoc[tag=unconstrained]
====

If we didn't use the `link:` prefix in this case, the URL macro would not be detected by the parser.
// end::link[]

A URL may not display correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (`+_+`) or carets (`+^`).

Next, we'll add a target and role to a link macro.

// tag::attr[]
[#link-macro-attributes]
=== Link macro attributes

Prior to 1.5.7, Asciidoctor _does not_ parse attributes in the link macro by default.
If you want attributes in the link macro to be parsed, you must set the `linkattrs` document attribute in the header.
Since 1.5.7, this parsing is automatic (and the attribute is not required) if an equal sign is found after a comma.
When attribute parsing is enabled, you can then specify the name of the target window using the `window` attribute.

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=linkattrs-h]
----

====
include::example$url.adoc[tag=linkattrs]
====

Since `_blank` is the most common window name, we've introduced shorthand for it.
Just end the link text with a caret (`+^+`):

[source]
----
include::example$url.adoc[tag=linkattrs-s]
----

CAUTION: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

You can also add a role (i.e., CSS class) to the link using an attribute declaration (which implicitly enables attribute parsing).

[source]

include::example$url.adoc[tag=css]
----

====
include::example$url.adoc[tag=css]
====

TIP: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
When they're enabled, you must surround the link text in double quotes if it contains a comma.
// end::attr[]
