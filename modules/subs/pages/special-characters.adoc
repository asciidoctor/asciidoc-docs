= Special Character Substitutions
:navtitle: Special Characters
:table-caption: Table
:y: Yes
:n: No

The special characters substitution step searches for three characters (`<`, `>`, `&`) and replaces them with their xref:replacements.adoc#char-ref-sidebar[named character references].

* The less than symbol, `<`, is replaced with the named character reference `\&lt;`.
* The greater than symbol, `>`, is replaced with the named character reference `\&gt;`.
* An ampersand, `&`, is replaced with the named character reference `\&amp;`.

== specialchars substitution value

The special characters substitution step can be modified on blocks and inline elements.
For blocks, the step's name, `specialchars`, can be assigned to the xref:apply-subs-to-blocks.adoc[subs attribute].
For inline elements, the built-in values `c` or `specialchars` can be applied to xref:apply-subs-to-text.adoc[inline text] to add the special characters substitution step.

[NOTE]
====
Special character substitution precedes attribute substitution, so you need to manually escape any attributes containing special characters that you set in the CLI or API.
For example, on the command line, type `+-a toc-title="Sections, Tables \&amp; Figures"+` instead of `-a toc-title="Sections, Tables & Figures"`.
